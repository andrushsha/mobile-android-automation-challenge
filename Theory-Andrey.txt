1) I'm to lazy to wrote own framework for test exercise. Kaspresso have all wrappers what I needed.
2) Advantages:
 - lovely dsl
 - wrappers for all UI-elements used in this App, even Intents
 Disadvantages:
 - documentation is poor
3) - Code-style
   - Code-readable
   - Consistency
4) If team can read code, than they can write new tests.
